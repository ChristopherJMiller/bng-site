    bio: `My first experience with smash was as a casual Marth main back in brawl. Unlike most ultimate players, I have never played smash 4. For a few years I didn’t play smash at all, and I only got back into it after starting to play brawl again with Bobban about a year ago. Since ultimate’s release I have begun taking smash a bit more seriously and hope to improve in the upcoming season. `
